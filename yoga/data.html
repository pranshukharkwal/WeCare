  <h3>1. Mountain Pose</h3>
  <h5><em>Sanskrit:</em> Tadasana</h5>
  <h4>How to do it</h4>
  <p>Stand with your feet together or hip-width apart. Ground down through the four corners of your feet. Roll your
    shoulders away from your ears, draw your shoulder blades down your back, and lift the crown of your head.</p>
  <p>Engage your thighs, draw your belly button in, and lengthen up through the spine. Turn your palms facing the
    front of the room. Relax your jaw and unfurrow your brow. Breathe easy.</p>
  <h4>The benefits</h4>
  <p>It may seem like you’re, well, just standing there, but bear with us. This is the blueprint for all other
    poses.
    It promotes balance and directs your attention to the present moment.</p>


  <h3>2. Chair Pose</h3>
  <h5><em>Sanskrit:</em> Utkatasana</h5>
  <h4>How to do it</h4>
  <p>Start in Mountain Pose. As you inhale, raise your arms, spread your fingers, and reach up through your
    fingertips. As you exhale, sit back and down as if sitting into a chair. </p>
  <p>Shift your weight toward the heels and lengthen up through the spine. As you inhale, lift and lengthen through
    your arms. As you exhale, sit deeper into the pose.</p>
  <h4>The benefits</h4>
  <p>This heating standing pose (give it a minute, you’ll feel the burn) strengthens your legs, upper back, and
    shoulders. As a bonus, you’ll have an opportunity to practice patience as your thighs work hard. Just remember
    to
    breathe. </p>


  <h3>3. Down Dog on a chair </h3>
  <h5><em>Sanskrit</em>: Uttana shishosana</h5>
  <h4>How to do it</h4>
  <p>Place your hands on the back of a chair with palms shoulder-distance apart. Step your feet back until they
    align
    under hips, creating a right angle with your body, spine parallel with the floor. </p>
  <p>Ground through your feet and lift through thighs. Reach hips away from hands to lengthen the sides of your
    torso.
    Firm your outer arms in and lengthen through the crown of your head.</p>
  <h4>The benefits</h4>
  <p>Downward-Facing Dog is the bread and butter of yoga, but it can be challenging for beginners. </p>
  <p>This modification shares the same benefits as the classic pose — stretching the hamstrings, opening the
    shoulders, and creating length in the spine — without all the weight on your upper body. </p>


  <h3>4. Downward-Facing Dog</h3>
  <h5><em>Sanskrit</em>: Adho Mukha Svanasana</h5>
  <h4>How to do it</h4>
  <p>From all fours, walk your hands 6 inches in front of you. Tuck your toes and lift your hips up and back to
    lengthen your spine. If your hamstrings are tight, keep your knees bent in order to bring your weight back into
    the legs. </p>
  <p>Spread your fingers wide, press into your hands, and rotate your arms so that your biceps are facing toward one
    another. Press your thighs back toward the wall behind you.</p>
  <h4>The benefits</h4>
  <p>This classic pose opens your shoulders, lengthens your spine, and stretches your hamstrings. Since your head is
    below your heart, the mild inversion creates a calming effect.</p>

  <h3>5. Warrior II</h3>
  <h5><em>Sanskrit</em>: Virabhadrasana II</h5>
  <h4><strong>How to do it</strong></h4>
  <p>Stand with feet wide, 3–4 feet apart. Shift your right heel out so your toes are pointing slightly inward. Turn
    your left foot out 90 degrees. Line up your left heel with the arch of your right foot. </p>
  <p>Bend your left knee to a 90-degree angle, keeping the knee in line with the second toe to protect the knee
    joint.
    Stretch through your straight back leg and ground down into the back foot. </p>
  <p>On an inhale, bring arms to a T at shoulder height. Draw your shoulder blades down the back. Spread your
    fingers
    and keep palms facedown. Gaze over the front fingers. As you exhale, sink deeper into the stretch. </p>
  <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> To draw your shoulder blades down the back, rotate your palms face-up. Notice how
    that
    shifts your shoulders. Once settled, rotate your palms facedown.</p>
  <h4><strong>The benefits</strong></h4>
  <p>A pose with “warrior” in its name may not sound very zen, but this standing pose can help calm and steady your
    mind. Tougher than it looks, it also strengthens your legs and ankles while increasing stamina.</p>

  <h3>6. Triangle Pose</h3>
  <h5><em>Sanskrit</em>: Trikonasana</h5>
  <h4>How to do it</h4>
  <p>Stand with feet wide, 3–4 feet apart. Shift your right heel out so your toes are pointing slightly inward. Turn
    your left foot out 90 degrees. Line up your left heel with the arch of your right foot. </p>
  <p>Keeping both legs straight, ground through your feet. Lift arms into a T at shoulder height. Reach forward with
    your front arm. When you can’t reach anymore, hinge at the front hip.</p>
  <p>Bring your front arm down to your shin, a foam block, or the ground. Lift your back arm up toward the sky and
    spread your fingers. Take your gaze down to the floor or up toward your lifted hand.</p>
  <h4>The benefits</h4>
  <p>While this pose can be challenging for <a href=\"https://greatist.com/move/yoga-mega-inflexible-people\"
      class=\"content-link css-1egta35\">those with tight muscles</a>, it will help promote balance, stretch the
    hamstrings and inner thighs, and create a feeling of expansion in the body.</p>

  <h3>7. Tree Pose</h3>
  <h5><em>Sanskrit</em>: Vrksasana</h5>
  <h4>How to do it</h4>
  <p>Start in Mountain Pose. Find a fixed point in front of you and stare at it to help you balance. </p>
  <p>As you inhale, shift the weight into your left foot and lift your right foot an inch off the floor. Using your
    right hand, bring the foot to your shin or inner thigh. Avoid placing your foot directly on the knee. </p>
  <p>As you exhale, ground through the standing leg and lengthen through the crown of your head. Bring your palms to
    touch in front of your sternum into prayer hands. </p>
  <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> To play with your balance, lift your hands up toward the sky in a V-shape. Take your
    gaze up toward the ceiling. If you’re an experienced practitioner, you can even try closing your eyes. </p>
  <h4>The benefits</h4>
  <p>This pose helps improve <a href=\"http://greatist.com/happiness/is-multitasking-bad-plus-how-to-stop\"
      class=\"content-link css-1egta35\">concentration</a> and your ability to balance by strengthening the arches
    of
    the feet and the outer hips.</p>


  <h3>8. Bridge Pose</h3>
  <h5><em>Sanskrit</em>: Setu Bandha Sarvangasana</h5>
  <h4>How to do it</h4>
  <p>Lie faceup with knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and arms at your sides with palms facedown. Keep your feet
    parallel and hip-width apart, heels stacked under knees. </p>
  <p>On an inhale, activate through the legs and the glutes. Press the floor away with your feet and lift the hips
    off
    the floor toward the sky. </p>
  <p>If your shoulders are tight and you want more leverage, try holding the sides of your yoga mat and lifting your
    hips. You may also wish to interlace your fingers underneath your “bridge” and shimmy your shoulders under the
    chest. </p>
  <p>When you’re ready to come down, lift your heels up and slowly lower your hips back to the ground, one vertebra
    at
    a time.</p>
  <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> To keep your knees from bowing out to the side, place a block between the upper
    thighs.
    Squeeze it tight as you lift up into Bridge Pose.</p>
  <h4>The benefits</h4>
  <p>This energizing backbend opens your chest and stretches your neck and spine. It can calm the mind, <a
      href=\"http://greatist.com/happiness/reduce-anxiety\" class=\"content-link css-1egta35\">reduce anxiety</a>,
    and
    help improve digestion.</p>


  <h3>9. Bound Ankle Pose</h3>
  <h5><em>Sanskrit</em>: Baddha Konasana</h5>
  <h4>How to do it</h4>
  <p>Sitting on the floor, bend knees and open them out to the side like a book. Join the soles of your feet
    together
    while sitting upright. </p>
  <p>Place fingertips on the floor directly behind you and lengthen up through the spine. You can also hold onto
    your
    ankles and hinge forward at the hips. </p>
  <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you’re feeling stiff, sit on the edge of a blanket to help your forward fold. </p>
  <h4>The benefits</h4>
  <p>You’ll give your inner thighs and groin a nice stretch, while the forward bend creates a calming, cooling
    effect.
  </p>


  <h3>10. Seated Forward Fold </h3>
  <h5><strong><em>Sanskrit: </em></strong>Paschimottanasana</h5>
  <h4>How to do it</h4>
  <p>Sit and straighten your legs out in front of you, grounding your thighs into the floor. Hinge at the hips to
    elongate your torso over your thighs. Grab hold of the outer edges of your feet. </p>
  <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If your hamstrings are tight, grab a strap and loop it behind your feet. Use the
    leverage to bring your torso closer to your thighs. You can also sit on the edge of a blanket to help you fold
    forward.</p>
  <h4>The benefits</h4>
  <p>This feel-good fold elongates the back of your body, lengthens your spine, and stretches your hamstrings.</p>


  <h3>11. Corpse Pose </h3>
  <h5><em>Sanskrit</em>: Savasana</h5>
  <h4>How to do it</h4>
  <p>Lie faceup, bringing your legs to the outer edges of your mat, like a starfish. Splay your feet out to the
    sides.
    Place arms along sides, palms facing up. Close your eyes and relax.</p>
  <h4>The benefits</h4>
  <p>Yep, it’s as simple as it sounds. Every yoga class includes Savasana, which relaxes the whole body and gives
    you
    space to absorb the benefits of the practice. </p>
