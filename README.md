## **WeCare:** A self care app for anyone affected due to covid

### **Theme:** Overcoming Difficulties of Lockdown

### Objective

WeCare is a self-care app for everyone affected by Covid-19 and have become mentally and physically stressed. Our goal is to keep them in the right attitude and condition until the Covid ends, and help them keep working towards personal betterment.

### What it does (Features)

WeCare comes as a solution to provide an integrated application with the following features:

1. **Group chat** (Personalized rooms to chat with doctors, friends, etc., plus a public room) - A way to help them come out of their loneliness and give them a chance to bond with each other. This will make them feel that they are not the only ones struck due to this pandemic and they would feel less anxious.

2. **Content recommendations** (Music, articles, movies, news, etc.) - To keep their mind busy in this difficult situation.

3. **ToDo list and calendar** - A person has a lot in his mind, this feature will help one to schedule everything properly and efficiently. One could mark the important dates in the calendar and it will give you a prior notification about the same.

4. **Light fitness regimes along with yoga and meditations** as user demands - A fit body is also a must! This feature will take care of just that. We will provide the person with helpful meditation exercises and yoga asanas in order to calm their mind.

5. **Motivating and positive messages** for everyone as they open the app every day - Positive messages keep them motivated and will not let them lose their touch during this pandemic.

### Implementation

We have majorly using **flask framework**, **google firebase** , **socket.io** and **javascript** to make our website. For group chats, we would be using flask and use sockets for the messages and for to-do list and calendar, we would be using firebase to store the data and javascript and css for the design part. Rest of the features wonâ€™t require a database, thus only javascript would be majorly required.
